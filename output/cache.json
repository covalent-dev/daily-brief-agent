      "summary": "<p>I built this tool because I found existing \"agentic\" tools too opaque. Most of the time I know what I want to change and I just want the AI to do it.<p>The core thesis is that agentic discovery is a waste of a model's \"intelligence budget.\" By letting the engineer pick what and where, the AI can focus on just writing the code correctly. This mostly involves:\n - Robust parsing to ensure the LLM's intended changes actually get applied\n - UX/workflow convenience so you're wasting minimal time interfacing with the tool\n - automatic validation, retries, backup, etc. to avoid wasting time bookkeeping<p>Happy to answer any questions. I tried to add some onboarding before I pushed but it's very much built for my own workflow.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Comments URL: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492985\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46492985</a></p>\n<p>Points: 1</p>\n<p># Comments: 0</p>",
